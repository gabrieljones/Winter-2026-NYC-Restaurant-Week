# Agent Instructions

## Environment Setup

* **JDK 25 Requirement:**
  - Agents must ensure that JDK 25 (Temurin distribution) is installed.
  - If JDK 25 is missing from the VM, install it using SDKMAN or your preferred method:
    ```bash
    sdk install java 25-tem
    ```
  - Verify installation with `java -version`.
